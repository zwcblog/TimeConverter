        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Timestamp Converter Pro ("the Extension"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling
            any personal information we obtain from you with care and respect. This Privacy Policy is designed to answer
            your questions regarding our privacy practices.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any user data.</strong> Timestamp Converter Pro is designed to
            work entirely locally on your device, without sending any information to external servers.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Local Storage</h2>
        <p>
            The Extension uses the browser's local storage capabilities to save:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>User preferences (such as preferred timezone)</li>
            <li>Conversion history (recent timestamp/date conversions)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This information is stored exclusively on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or any third parties.
            You can clear this data at any time by clearing your browser's local storage or by using the "Clear History" button
            within the Extension.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
        <p>
            Timestamp Converter Pro requests the following permissions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>activeTab</strong>: Used only to enable the copy-to-clipboard functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>clipboardWrite</strong>: Allows the Extension to copy conversion results to your clipboard when you click the "Copy" button.</li>
            <li><strong>storage</strong>: Enables the Extension to store your preferences and conversion history locally on your device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These permissions are used solely for providing the core functionality of the Extension and not for collecting or transmitting user data.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Timestamp Converter Pro does not utilize any third-party services, analytics tools, trackers, or advertisements.
            The Extension operates in isolation and does not communicate with external services.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Timestamp Converter Pro does not specifically target children under 13, nor do we knowingly collect personal information
            from children under 13. As we don't collect any user data at all, no personal information of any users, regardless of age,
            is collected.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal,
            or regulatory reasons. The date of the latest revision will be indicated at the top of the Privacy Policy.
        </p>
